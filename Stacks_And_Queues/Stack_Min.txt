Question: How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which
returns the minimum element? Push, pop, and min should all operation in O(1) time.


Answer: Assume we start with an empty stack. The stack class will have a class attribute called smallest that is also a stack.
When an element is pushed onto the stack, we check if the new element is smaller than the current min. If it is smaller,
then it is pushed onto our smallest stack. If the current smallest element is popped from the stack,
then the next element in our smallest stack becomes the current min.
