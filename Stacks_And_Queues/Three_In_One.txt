Question: Describe how you could use a single array to implement 3 stacks

Answer: If 2D arrays are allowed then a single array could contain another array at its first 3 indices.

If 2D arrays are not allowed, then you could use a sufficiently large array divided into 3 part,
with each being it's own stack

Finally, if 2D arrays are still not allowed, we could do flexible divisions in the array,
moving around elements as needed based on how big the 3 stacks get.
An error would be raised if the whole array was full.
